## Running this Project
To run this project, just hit the `run` button, wait until your emulator is completely up and 
running and use the application!
Just a reminder, if you do not initially see data on your first time running the application, 
it might be because the server returned a bad response so feel free to just load the screen again!
Also, if you run into any errors with building, please let me know. I initially had some kt 
compatibility issues in the beginning but I resolved them by changing the gradle.
